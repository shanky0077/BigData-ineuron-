# BigData-ineuron-
Some of the highlights I've worked on with:
ğŸ‘‰ Create a KAFKA cluster
ğŸ‘‰ Tweek basic configurations of the cluster
ğŸ‘‰ Create a Topic
ğŸ‘‰ Create a Schema Registry and add a schema
ğŸ‘‰ Took a Car Dataset with data of car_names,car_company,price etc..
ğŸ‘‰ Write/Publish data using serialisation via the Producer
ğŸ‘‰ Stream the data via Kafka
ğŸ‘‰ Consume the data using de-serialisation via the Consumer
